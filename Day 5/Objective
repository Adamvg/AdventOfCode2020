Binary space partitioning
0-127 rows (128 rows) (F/B)
0-7 columns (8 columns) L/R
F/L: lower half
B/R: upper half

FBFBBFFRLR = row 44, column 5

Every seat also has a unique seat ID: multiply the row by 8, then add the column.
In this example, the seat has ID 44 * 8 + 5 = 357.


--- part 2 ---
seats at the front and back dont exist, what's the only missing seat id?
